If we divide the histogram into equal size parts, without reference to the number of pixels in
each part, we may get a part where the number of pixels is 0.
In the calculation process, we divide the segment's hue span by the number of pixels.
So if we divide by the number of pixels in the part where the number is 0 we get a division by 0
and the software will crash.
So we make sure that each part of the distribution has a similar number of pixels
and so we do not get a division by 0.
